# RGBWatermark

Protects your art against machine learning theft with a customizable rainbow watermark.

As long as you set the opacity above 0 your art will be completely useless for machine learning with 
no possible way to undo it. And if you upload your art as a GIF file it will be ignored by most bots.

Of course it is very destructive but it is meant for people who want to post their art on social media and keep their unwatermarked artworks on their personal website or blog.
